				    <h3>My Background</h3>
					<p>First off, let me tell you why I like to dance. It is (in my opinion) the BEST way to express yourself. 
						some people choose to express themselves through listening to music, drawing, singing, etc. I enjoy all
						of those things as well;however, dance is my favorite. I started dancing when I was 3 years old and I am
						now 19, which would total out to 16 years. Dance has been a HUGE part of my life for the past 16 years. I 
						have attended 3 dance studios and have competed with 4 different competition teams. When I was younger I 
						started out with just ballet, tap, and jazz. As I grew older, I continued with those genres AND added even more 
						genres to my list. By the time I turned 19 I had Ballet, Tap, Jazz, PrePointe, Pointe, Modern, Musical Theatre, 
						Lyrical, Poms, and Hip Hop all under my belt. I have also been to state 7 times for both team routines and solo routines,
						and I have been to Nationals 6 times with both team and solo routines as well. Nationals was absolutely amazing every 
						year i attended. My junior year of high school my team was awarded with Grand Championship and I personally was awarded 
						first place for my solo. Overall, dance has been everything to me for the past 16 years, and I can't wait to share my
						knowledge of the spectacular sport with all of you. </p>
